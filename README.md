# CodeDev
My first self-designed, fully responsive website—no templates, no cloning. Built from scratch using HTML and CSS. A personal milestone in learning layout design, responsiveness, and clean UI structure.

Built HTML and CSS to explore layout techniques, media queries, and user-friendly design. Proudly beginner-made, thoughtfully structured.

This repo showcases my first responsive website built entirely from scratch. It reflects my journey into frontend development, responsive design, and clean coding practices. No cloning—just learning, building, and growing.
